Spatio-Temporal Encoder - version 2 (STE-v2) for action spotting in soccer videos.

This version improves the tight a-mAP evaluation metric from 40% to 58.29% on test data and 58.7% on challenge data.

Differenece from STE-v1 is that prediction layer is now designed for two predictions (the class event that occurred in the window and the time frame where the event occurred in the window).
